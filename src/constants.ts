// Runtime catalog metadata. `category` separates the two kinds of runtime:

//                 Antigravity, …). These are the ones offered on the homepage
//                 composer picker.
//   • "harness" — a separate agent harness/wrapper that runs ON a base protocol
//                 (Pi, OpenCode, Hermes, OpenClaw, Paperclip, Motorcar). These
//                 are listed ONLY in the Runtimes catalog (their own group), never
//                 on the homepage.
// `protocol` is the base CLI protocol the runtime speaks (so dispatch can route to
// a known handler). `install` drives the "Set up" prompt. Detection: detect_clis.
// `cmd` (optional): a copy-paste install command for macOS, set ONLY where the
// exact command is known/safe — the UI shows a "Copy install command" button
// when present, and falls back to the docs link otherwise.
